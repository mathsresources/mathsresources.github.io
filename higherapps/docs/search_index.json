This template shows how instructors can easily create interactive web documents that students can use in self-guided learning. The {webexercises} package provides a number of functions that you use in inline R code or through code chunk options to create HTML widgets (text boxes, pull down menus, buttons that reveal hidden content). Examples are given below. Knit this file to HTML to see how it works. NOTE: To use the widgets in the compiled HTML file, you need to have a JavaScript-enabled browser. 1.1 Fill-In-The-Blanks (fitb()) Create fill-in-the-blank questions using fitb(), providing the answer as the first argument. 2 + 2 is You can also create these questions dynamically, using variables from your R session. x &lt;- sample(2:8, 1) The square root of 9 is: The blanks are case-sensitive; if you don’t care about case, use the argument ignore_case = TRUE. What is the letter after D? If you want to ignore differences in whitespace use, use the argument ignore_ws = TRUE (which is the default) and include spaces in your answer anywhere they could be acceptable. How do you load the tidyverse package? You can set more than one possible correct answer by setting the answers as a vector. Type a vowel: You can use regular expressions to test answers against more complex rules. Type any 3 letters: 1.2 Multiple Choice (mcq()) “Never gonna give you up, never gonna: let you goturn you downrun awaylet you down” “I bless the rainsguess it rainssense the rain down in Africa” -Toto 1.3 True or False (torf()) True or False? You can permute values in a vector using sample(). TRUEFALSE 1.4 Longer MCQs (longmcq()) When your answers are very long, sometimes a drop-down select box gets formatted oddly. You can use longmcq() to deal with this. Since the answers are long, It’s probably best to set up the options inside an R chunk with echo=FALSE. What is a p-value? opts_p &lt;- c( &quot;the probability that the null hypothesis is true&quot;, answer = &quot;the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true&quot;, &quot;the probability of making an error in your conclusion&quot; ) the probability that the null hypothesis is true the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true the probability of making an error in your conclusion What is true about a 95% confidence interval of the mean? # use sample() to randomise the order opts_ci &lt;- sample(c( answer = &quot;if you repeated the process many times, 95% of intervals calculated in this way contain the true mean&quot;, &quot;there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this range&quot;, &quot;95% of the data fall within this range&quot; )) 95% of the data fall within this range if you repeated the process many times, 95% of intervals calculated in this way contain the true mean there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this range 1.5 Checked sections Create sections with the class webex-check to add a button that hides feedback until it is pressed. Add the class webex-box to draw a box around the section (or use your own styles). I am going to learn a lot: TRUEFALSE opts &lt;- c( &quot;the probability that the null hypothesis is true&quot;, answer = &quot;the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true&quot;, &quot;the probability of making an error in your conclusion&quot; ) cat(&quot;What is a p-value?&quot;, longmcq(opts)) What is a p-value? the probability that the null hypothesis is true the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true the probability of making an error in your conclusion 1.6 Hidden solutions and hints You can fence off a solution area that will be hidden behind a button using hide() before the solution and unhide() after, each as inline R code. Pass the text you want to appear on the button to the hide() function. If the solution is an RMarkdown code chunk, instead of using hide() and unhide(), simply set the webex.hide chunk option to TRUE, or set it to the string you wish to display on the button. Recreate the scatterplot below, using the built-in cars dataset. with(cars, plot(speed, dist)) I need a hint See the documentation for plot() (?plot) Click here to see the solution plot(cars$speed, cars$dist) 1.7 Mathematical Models 1.8 Units of Measure 1.9 Error and Tolerance 1.10 "],["statistics.html", "2 Statistics", " 2 Statistics "],["project.html", "Project", " Project "],["finance.html", "3 Finance", " 3 Finance "],["planning.html", "4 Planning", " 4 Planning "],["exam-preparation.html", "Exam Preparation", " Exam Preparation "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
