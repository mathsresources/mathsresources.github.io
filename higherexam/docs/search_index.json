Question 1 (4 marks) Hint 1 To find the equation of a line you will need to find its gradient. How can you find the gradient of a tangent to a curve? Hint 2 Differentiate and substitute in \\(x=\\) to find the gradient of the tangent. Next you just need to know a point the tangent passes through. How can you find the \\(y\\)-coordinate which corresponds to \\(x=2\\)? Hint 3 Substitute \\(x=2\\) into \\(y=x^3-2x^2+5\\) to find the corresponding \\(y\\)-coordinate. Use that coordinate together with the gradient found and the straight line equation \\(y-b=m(x-a)\\). Answer \\(y=4x-3\\) Solution Question 2 (4 marks) Hint 1 What are the properties of a perpendicular bisector? Hint 2 Start by finding the gradient of line AB. What then is the gradient of its perpendicular bisector? Hint 3 Once you have the gradient perpendicular to line AB, find the midpoint of AB. This coordinate and the perpendicular gradient can be used with \\(y-b=m(x-a)\\). Answer \\(3y=-4x+41\\) or \\(y=-\\dfrac{4}{3}x+\\dfrac{41}{3}\\) Solution Question 3 (4 marks) Hint 1 One of the terms is not yet ready to be integrated. Which one? How can it be rewritten? Hint 2 \\(\\dfrac{12}{x^2}\\) can be written as \\(12x^{-2}\\). The rule for integrating is increase the power by one then divide by the new power. What should the answer to an indefinite integration include? Hint 3 Dividing by \\(\\dfrac{3}{2}\\) is the same as multiplying by \\(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\). Remember to simplify each part as much as possible and include \"\\(+\\mathrm{C}\\)\". Answer \\(-12x^{-1}+\\dfrac{2}{3}x^{\\frac{3}{2}}+\\mathrm{C}\\) Solution Question 4 (3 marks) Hint 1 What are the three log laws? Which must be applied first here? Hint 2 Use the power law \\(y\\log_ax=\\log_ax^y\\) to remove the \\(2\\) from the front of the first log. Next, what happens when to logs are added? Hint 3 Remember that \\(3^{-1}=\\dfrac{1}{3}\\). What therefore is the value of \\(\\log_3{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}\\)? Answer \\(-1\\) Solution Question 5 (2 marks) Hint 1 This is a graph transformations question. What does the transformation \\(f(-x)\\dots\\) do? What does the transformation \\(f(\\dots)+3\\) do? Hint 2 Write down the three coordinates given on the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\). \\(f(-x)\\dots\\) \"flips\" the \\(x\\)-coordinates. \\(f(\\dots)+3\\) adds \\(3\\) to the \\(y\\)-coordinates. Write down the three transformed coordinates. Hint 3 The three coordinates are \\((-4,3\\), \\((0,6)\\) and \\((2,3)\\). Use them to sketch a graph which is \"flipped horizontally\" and shifted up \\(3\\). Answer Solution Question 6 (4 marks) Hint 1 The diagram shows angle \\(q\\) but the questions ask about \\(2Q\\). How can \\(\\sin{2q}\\) and \\(\\cos{2q}\\) be expanded? The length of the right-angled triangle's hypotenuse will be needed in this question. Hint 2 Use \\(\\sin{2q}=2\\sin{q}\\cos{q}\\) and \\(\\cos{2q}=2\\cos^2{q}-1\\). The length of the hypotenuse is \\(\\sqrt{5^2+1^2}\\). From the triangle, write down the values of \\(\\sin{q}\\) and \\(\\cos{q}\\). Hint 3 Substitute the values of \\(\\sin{q}=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{26}}\\) and \\(\\cos{q}=\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{26}}\\). Then simplify. Answer \\(\\sin{2q}=\\dfrac{5}{13}\\) and \\(\\cos{2q}=\\dfrac{12}{13}\\) Solution (3 marks) Hint 1 How can \\(\\sin{(2q-r)}\\) be expanded? Hint 2 Use \\(\\sin{(2q-r)}=\\sin{2q}\\cos{r}-\\cos{2q}\\sin{r}\\). The values of \\(\\sin{2q}\\) and \\(\\cos{2q}\\) have already been found in part (a). What are the values of \\(\\sin{r}\\) and \\(\\cos{r}\\)? Hint 3 Substitute \\(\\sin{r}=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\\) and \\(\\cos{r}=\\dfrac{4}{\\sqrt{17}}\\) into the expanded form. Answer \\(\\dfrac{8}{13\\sqrt{17}}\\) Solution Question 7 (5 marks) Hint 1 Hint 1. Hint 2 Hint 2. Hint 3 Hint 3. Answer Answer here. Solution Question 8 (3 marks) Hint 1 Hint 1. Hint 2 Hint 2.
